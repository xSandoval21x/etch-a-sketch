# etch-a-sketch
A web version of an etch-a-sketch
Project from the Odin Project curriculum

**Features:**
• Default 16 x 16 canvas
• Defaults to random colors
• Choose Color gives the colors of the rainbow as options
• Hide grid will hide the grid borders for a clear white canvas
• Reset grid prompts user for new grid size (Recommended range from 1 to 100)

Reflection:
• Utilized for loop as well as forEach function with DOM manipulation to create grid
• CSS Grid was very flexible and I overall liked using it
• Spent a lot of time becoming comfortable with DOM Manipulation
• I got stuck trying to figure out how to increase the opacity of each square upon hovering over it repeatedly
• Once I got all the javascript functionality, I added all my styling
• I wanted to utilize @keyframes animations so I spent time looking up animation tutorial on w3schools and MDN docs
• I had fun with this project and I really wanted it to be visually appealing so I spent more time with CSS on this project
