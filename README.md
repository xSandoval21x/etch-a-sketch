A web version of an etch-a-sketch
Project from the Odin Project curriculum

<h1>Features</h1>
<li>
  <ul>Default 16 x 16 canvas</ul>
  <ul>Defaults to random colors</ul>
  <ul>Choose Color gives the colors of the rainbow as options</ul>
  <ul>Hide grid will hide the grid borders for a clear white canvas</ul>
  <ul>Reset grid prompts user for new grid size (Recommended range from 1 to 100)</ul>
 </li>

<h1>Reflection</h1>
  <li>
    <ul>Utilized for loop as well as forEach function with DOM manipulation to create grid</ul>
    <ul>CSS Grid was very flexible and I overall liked using it</ul>
    <ul>I got stuck trying to figure out how to increase the opacity of each square upon hovering over it repeatedly</ul>
    <ul>Once I got all the javascript functionality, I added all my styling</ul>
    <ul>I wanted to utilize @keyframes animations so I spent time looking up animation tutorial on w3schools and MDN docs</ul>
    <ul>I had fun with this project and I really wanted it to be visually appealing so I spent more time with CSS on this project</ul>
   </li>
