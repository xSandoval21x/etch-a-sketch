# etch-a-sketch
A web version of an etch-a-sketch
Project from the Odin Project curriculum

<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Default 16 x 16 canvas</li>
  <li>Defaults to random colors</li>
  <li>Choose Color gives the colors of the rainbow as options</li>
  <li>Hide grid will hide the grid borders for a clear white canvas</li>
  <li>Reset grid prompts user for new grid size (Recommended range from 1 to 100)</li>
 </ul>

<h1>Reflection</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Utilized for loop as well as forEach function with DOM manipulation to create grid</li>
  <li>CSS Grid was very flexible and I overall liked using it</li>
  <li>I got stuck trying to figure out how to increase the opacity of each square upon hovering over it repeatedly</li>
  <li>Once I got all the javascript functionality, I added all my styling</li>
  <li>I wanted to utilize @keyframes animations so I spent time looking up animation tutorial on w3schools and MDN docs</li>
  <li>I had fun with this project and I really wanted it to be visually appealing so I spent more time with CSS on this project</li>
 </ul>
